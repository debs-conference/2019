                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Computing Systems are undergoing a multitude of interesting
                                changes:
                                from the
                                platforms (cloud, appliances) to the workloads, data types, and operations (big
                                data, machine learning). Many of these changes are driven or being tackled
                                through innovation in hardware even to the point of having fully specialized
                                designs for particular applications. In this talk I will review some of the most
                                important changes happening in hardware and discuss how they affect system
                                design as well as the opportunities they create. I will focus on data processing
                                with an emphasis on streams and event based systems but also discuss
                                applications in other areas. I will also briefly discuss how these trends are
                                likely to result in a very different form of IT, and consequently of Computer
                                Science, from the one we know today.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Quantitative models in informatics are well accepted and
                                employed,
                                whereas
                                qualitative, conceptual, modeling is frequently considered with scepticism: huge
                                effort is said to trade for poor benefit.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In this talk I discuss criteria for adequate conceptual models
                                of
                                event driven
                                systems, and discuss what kind of benefit such models may yield.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In particular, I will argue that an adequate model supports not
                                only
                                understanding, abstraction, structure, behavior, and user interaction. In
                                addition, a lot of nontrivial, deep insight can be gained, including invariants
                                in a broad sense, with e.g. models in physics as a role model.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In a few short years, the Function-as-a-Service paradigm has
                                revolutionized how
                                we think about distributed event processing. Within seconds, developers can
                                deploy and run event-driven functions in the cloud that scale on demand. CIOs
                                love the high availability and zero administration. CFOs love the fine-grained,
                                pay-as-you-go pricing model.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Most FaaS platforms today are biased toward (if not restricted
                                to)
                                simple
                                functions, functions that only run for a short while, use limited CPU and
                                memory, and process relatively small amounts of data. In this talk, we will get
                                a closer look at FaaS platforms (using Apache OpenWhisk as our exemplar) to
                                understand these trade-offs.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Functions are not applications. To build compelling FaaS
                                applications we need to
                                compose functions. In this talk, we will compare approaches to function
                                composition both from a developer and from a system's perspective. We will show
                                how composition can dramatically expand the scope of FaaS.</p>

                            <h4 class="mb-20">Tyler Akidau</h4>


                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In the last four years, stream processing has gone from niche to
                                mainstream, with
                                real-time data processing systems gaining traction in not only fast-moving
                                startups, but also their more skeptical and cautious enterprise brethren. In
                                light of such pervasive adoption, is it safe to say we've we finally reached the
                                point where stream processing is a solved commodity? Are we done and ready to
                                move on to the next big thing?</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In this talk, I will argue that the answer to those questions is
                                conclusively
                                "no": stream processing as a field of research is alive and well. In fact, as
                                streaming systems evolve to look more and more alike, the need for active
                                exploration of new ideas is all the more pressing. And though streaming systems
                                are more capable and robust than ever, they remain in many ways difficult to
                                use, difficult to maintain, and difficult to understand. But we can change
                                that.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">I don't claim to have all the answers; no one does. But I do
                                have a
                                few ideas of
                                where we can start. And by sharing my thoughts on some of the more interesting
                                open problems in stream processing, and encouraging others to share theirs, I'm
                                hoping that we as a research community can work together to help move the needle
                                just a little bit further.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Online event processing are abound ranging from web and mobile
                                applications to
                                data processing. Such event processing applications often require the ability to
                                ingest, store, dispatch and process events. Until now, supporting all of these
                                needs has required different systems for each task -- stream processing engines,
                                messaging queuing middleware, and pub/sub messaging systems. This has led to the
                                unnecessary complexity for the development of such applications and operations
                                leading to increased barrier to adoption in the enterprises.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In this keynote, Karthik will outline the need to unify these
                                capabilities in a
                                single system and make it easy to develop and operate at scale. Karthik will
                                delve into how Apache Pulsar was designed to address this need with an elegant
                                architecture. Apache Pulsar is a next generation distributed pub-sub system that
                                was originally developed and deployed at Yahoo and running in production in more
                                than 100+ companies. Karthik will explain how the architecture and design of
                                Pulsar provides the flexibility to support developers and applications needing
                                any combination of queuing, messaging, streaming and lightweight compute for
                                events. Furthermore, he will provide real life use cases how Apache Pulsar is
                                used for event processing ranging from data processing tasks to web processing
                                applications.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Despite the established scientific knowledge on efficient
                                parallel and elastic
                                data stream processing, it is challenging to combine generality and high level
                                of abstraction (targeting ease of use) with fine-grained processing aspects
                                (targeting efficiency) in stream processing frameworks. Towards this goal, we
                                propose STRETCH, a framework that aims at guaranteeing (i) high efficiency in
                                throughput and latency of stateful analysis and (ii) fast elastic
                                reconfigurations (without requiring state transfer) for intra-node streaming
                                applications. To achieve these, we introduce virtual shared-nothing
                                parallelization and propose a scheme to implement it in STRETCH, enabling users
                                to leverage parallelization techniques while also taking advantage of
                                shared-memory synchronization, which has been proven to boost the scaling-up of
                                streaming applications while supporting determinism. We provide a
                                fully-implemented prototype and, together with a thorough evaluation,
                                correctness proofs for its underlying claims supporting determinism and a model
                                (also validated empirically) of virtual shared-nothing and pure shared-nothing
                                scalability behavior. As we show, STRETCH can match the throughput and latency
                                figures of the front of state-of-the-art solutions, while also achieving fast
                                elastic reconfigurations (taking only a few milliseconds).</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In modern Stream Processing Engines (SPEs), numerous diverse
                                applications, which
                                can differ in aspects such as cost, criticality or latency sensitivity, can
                                co-exist in the same computing node. When these differences need to be
                                considered to control the performance of each application, custom scheduling of
                                operators to threads is of key importance (e.g., when a smart vehicle needs to
                                ensure that safety-critical applications always have access to computational
                                power, while other applications are given lower, variable priorities).</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Many solutions have been proposed regarding schedulers that
                                allocate threads to
                                operators to optimize specific metrics (e.g., latency) but there is still lack
                                of a tool that allows arbitrarily complex scheduling strategies to be seamlessly
                                plugged on top of an SPE. We propose Haren to fill this gap. More specifically,
                                we (1) formalize the thread scheduling problem in stream processing in a general
                                way, allowing to define ad-hoc scheduling policies, (2) identify the bottlenecks
                                and the opportunities of scheduling in stream processing, (3) distill a compact
                                interface to connect Haren with SPEs, enabling rapid testing of various
                                scheduling policies, (4) illustrate the usability of the framework by
                                integrating it into an actual SPE and (5) provide a thorough evaluation. As we
                                show, Haren makes it is possible to adapt the use of computational resources
                                over time to meet the goals of a variety of scheduling policies.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Data Stream Processing (DSP) has emerged as a key enabler to
                                develop pervasive
                                services that require to process data in a near real-time fashion. DSP
                                applications keep up with the high volume of produced data by scaling their
                                execution on multiple computing nodes, so as to process the incoming data flow
                                in parallel. Workloads variability requires to elastically adapt the application
                                parallelism at run-time in order to avoid over-provisioning. Elasticity policies
                                for DSP have been widely investigated, but mostly under the simplifying
                                assumption of homogeneous infrastructures. The resulting solutions do not
                                capture the richness and inherent complexity of modern infrastructures, where
                                heterogeneous computing resources are available on-demand. In this paper, we
                                formulate the problem of controlling elasticity on heterogeneous resources as a
                                Markov Decision Process (MDP). The resulting MDP is not easily solved by
                                traditional techniques due to state space explosion, and thus we show how linear
                                Function Approximation and Tile Coding can be used to efficiently compute
                                elasticity policies at run-time. In order to deal with parameters uncertainty,
                                we integrate the proposed approach with Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Our
                                numerical evaluation shows the efficacy of the presented solutions compared to
                                standard methods in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.</p>

                                of a Big Active Data
                                Publish Subscribe (BAD Pub/Sub) systems to enable the next generation of
                                enriched notification systems that can scale to societal levels. The proposed
                                BAD Pub/Sub system will aim to ingest massive amounts of data from heterogeneous
                                publishers and sources and deliver customized, enriched notifications to end
                                users (subscribers) that express interests in these data items via parameterized
                                channels. To support scalability, we employ a hierarchical architecture that
                                combines a back-end big data cluster (to receive publications and data feeds,
                                store data and process subscriptions) with a client-facing distributed broker
                                network that manages user subscriptions and scales the delivery process. A key
                                aspect of our broker capacity is its ability to aggregate subscriptions from end
                                users to immensely reduce the end to end overheads and loads. The skewed
                                distribution of subscribers, their interests and the dynamic nature of societal
                                scale publications, create load imbalance in the distributed broker network. We
                                mathematically formulate the notion of broker load in this setting and derive an
                                optimization problem to minimize the maximum load (an NP-hard problem). We
                                propose a staged approach for broker load balancing that executes in multiple
                                stages --- initial placement of brokers to subscribers, dynamic subscriber
                                migration during operation to handle transient and instantaneous loads and
                                occasional shuffles to re-stabilize the system. We develop a prototype
                                implementation of our staged load balancing on a real BAD Pub/Sub testbed
                                (multinode cluster) with a distributed broker network and conduct experiments
                                using real world workloads. We further evaluate our schemes via a detailed

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Vehicles exchange Floating Car Data (FCD) to improve
                                awareness beyond their local
                                perception and thereby increase traffic safety and comfort. If the FCD is
                                required at distant locations, FCD can be shared using the cellular network to
                                notify vehicles early of upcoming road events. However, this monitoring of the
                                roads congests the cellular network, which is already utilized by other
                                applications. The available bandwidth for monitoring is expected to decrease
                                further with the introduction of fully autonomous vehicles.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In this paper, we propose a hybrid dissemination approach
                                for the distribution of
                                road events in vehicular networks. Our approach aims to utilize only a
                                predefined bandwidth for information exchange, which is achieved by two
                                mechanisms: (i) the offloading of information to Wifi-based Vehicle to Vehicle
                                (V2V) communication and (ii) the filtering of low-impact information. We offload
                                the information to Wifi-based communication using non-cooperative game-theory:
                                Each vehicle chooses the minimum impact of information it wants to receive via
                                the cellular network. Through cooperation, the vehicles in proximity might
                                provide information the other vehicles cannot receive. In the evaluation, we
                                show that our approach significantly improves the data quality at the vehicles
                                compared to traditional offloading approaches while sticking to the predefined
                                bandwidth constraints.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Location-based feed-following is a trending service that can
                                provide
                                contextually
                                relevant information to users based on their locations. In this paper, we
                                consider the view selection problem in a location-based feed-following system
                                that continuously provides aggregated query results over feeds that are located
                                within a certain range from users. Previous solutions adopt a user-centric
                                approach and require re-optimizations of the view selection once users move
                                their locations. Such methods limit the system's scalability to the number of
                                users and can be very costly when a substantial number of users move their
                                locations. To solve the problem, we propose the new concept of location-centric
                                query plans. In this approach, we use a grid to partition the space into cells
                                and generate view selection and query processing plans for each cell, and user
                                queries will be evaluated using the query plans associated with the users'
                                current locations. In this way, the problem's complexity and dynamicity is
                                largely determined by the granularity of the grid instead of the number of
                                users. To minimize the query processing cost, we further propose an algorithm to
                                generate an optimized set of materialized views to store the aggregated events
                                of some feeds and a number of location-centric query plans for each grid cell.
                                The algorithm can also efficiently adapt the plans according to the movement of
                                the users. We implement a prototype system by using Redis as the back-end
                                in-memory storage system for the materialized views and conduct extensive
                                experiments over two real datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of
                                our approach.</p>

                                recognition. In
                                streaming environments, the usual case is for data to arrive with a (variable)
                                delay from, and to be retracted/revised by the underlying sources. We propose
                                RTECinc, an incremental version of RTEC, a composite event recognition engine
                                with a formal, declarative semantics, that has been shown to scale to several
                                real-world data streams. RTEC deals with delayed arrival and retraction of
                                events by computing at each query time composite event intervals from scratch.
                                This often results to redundant computations. Instead, RTECinc deals with delays
                                and retractions in a more efficient way, by updating only the affected events.
                                We evaluate RTECinc theoretically, presenting a complexity analysis, and show
                                the conditions in which it outperforms RTEC. Moreover, we compare RTECinc and
                                RTEC experimentally using two real-world datasets. The results are compatible
                                with our theoretical analysis and show that RTECinc may outperform RTEC.</p>

                                modern businesses
                                aiming to detect and efficiently react to critical situations in near real-time.
                                The need to govern the behavior of systems where such streams exist has led to
                                the development of numerous Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines, capable of
                                detecting patterns and analyzing event streams. Although current CEP systems
                                provide real-time analysis foundations for a variety of applications, several
                                challenges arise due to languages' limitations and imprecise semantics, as well
                                as the lack of power to handle big data requirements. In this paper, we discuss
                                such systems, analyzing some of the most sensitive issues in this domain.
                                Further in this context, we present our contributions expressed in LEAD, a
                                formal specification for processing complex events. LEAD provides an algebra
                                that consists of a set of operators for constructing complex events (patterns),
                                temporally restricting the construction process and choosing among several
                                selection and consumption policies. We show how to build LEAD rules to
                                demonstrate the expressive power of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a
                                novel approach of interpreting these rules into a logical execution plan, built
                                with temporal prioritized colored petri nets.</p>

                                data streams, namely RDF Stream processing (RSP), offers the opportunity to
                                integrate the background knowledge with RDF streams. In particular, RSP Engines
                                can continuously answer SPARQL queries while performing reasoning. However,
                                current RSP engines are at risk of failing to perform reasoning at the required

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Physical event detection has long been the domain of static
                                event
                                processors
                                operating on numeric sensor data. This works well for large scale strong-signal
                                events such as hurricanes, and important classes of events such as earthquakes.
                                However, for a variety of domains there is insufficient sensor coverage, e.g.,
                                landslides, wildfires, and flooding. Social networks have provided massive
                                volume of data from billions of users, but data from these generic social
                                sensors contain much more noise than physical sensors. One of the most difficult
                                challenges presented by social sensors is concept drift, where the terms
                                associated with a phenomenon evolve and change over time, rendering static
                                machine learning (ML) classifiers less effective. To address this problem, we
                                develop the ASSED (Adaptive Social Sensor Event Detection) framework with an
                                ML-based event processing engine and show how it can perform simple and complex
                                physical event detection on strong- and weak-signal with low-latency, high
                                scalability, and accurate coverage. Specifically, ASSED is a framework to
                                support continuous filter generation and updates with machine learning using
                                streaming data from high-confidence sources (physical and annotated sensors) and
                                social networks. We build ASSED to support procedures for integrating
                                high-confidence sources into social sensor event detection to generate
                                high-quality filters and to perform dynamic filter selection by tracking its own
                                performance. We demonstrate ASSED capabilities through a landslide detection
                                application that detects almost 350% more landslides compared to static
                                approaches. More importantly, ASSED automates the handling of concept drift:
                                four years after initial data collection and classifier training, ASSED achieves
                                event detection accuracy of 0.988 (without expert manual intervention), compared
                                to 0.762 for static approaches.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) combine communication, computation
                                and
                                data storage
                                capabilities to oversee and control physical processes in domains including
                                manufacturing, medical monitoring and smart grids. CPS behavior can be remotely
                                monitored by aggregating event data from various sensors, forwarded over
                                wireless networks. One of the main challenges for CPS application developers is
                                to manage event arrival-time boundaries and to trade off between timeliness and
                                completeness: waiting too long until all events arrive can fail to produce a
                                useful result, while not waiting long enough may lead to faults because the
                                status information is incomplete. Monitoring the production lines in a factory,
                                for example, depends on the aggregation of event data from multiple sensors in
                                the distributed CPS, such as temperature and movement. Yet, predicting
                                time-boundaries for individual event arrivals is difficult, if not impossible,
                                for an application developer, because the wireless network and the sensing
                                devices introduce latencies which vary continuously along with the load, status
                                or environmental conditions of the network and the sensors. This paper proposes
                                Khronos, a middleware that automatically determines timeouts for event arrivals
                                that improve timeliness, given completeness constraint(s) specified by the CPS
                                application developer and taking into account variations in event propagation
                                delays. Extensive evaluations on a physical testbed show that Khronos
                                considerably improves timeliness under varying network configurations and
                                conditions, while satisfying application-specific completeness constraints.</p>

                                data repair for event-driven, IoT applications. IoT devices are heterogeneous in
                                their hardware architectures, software, size, cost, capacity, network
                                capabilities, power requirements, etc. They must execute in a wide range of

                                hardware malfunction, software bugs, network partitions, etc. cannot be
                                immediately remediated. Further, many of these failure modes cause corruption in
                                the data that these devices produce and in the computations "downstream" that
                                depend on this data.</p>

                                in a distributed IoT setting, we explore SANS-SOUCI--a system for automatically
                                tracking causal data dependencies and re-initiating dependent computations in
                                event-driven IoT deployment frameworks. SANS-SOUCI presupposes an event-driven
                                programming model based on cloud functions, which we extend for portable
                                execution across IoT tiers (device, edge, cloud). We add fast, persistent,
                                append-only storage and versioning for efficient data robustness and durability.
                                SANS-SOUCI records events and their causal dependencies using a distributed
                                event log and repairs applications dynamically, across tiers via replay. We

                                example applications, and microbenchmarks. We find that SANS-SOUCI is able to
                                perform repair for both software (function) and sensor produced data corruption
                                with very low overhead.</p>

                                algorithms. In
                                an event-driven setting, the interesting aspect of termination is the
                                possibility of control flow loops through communication, which this paper aims
                                to investigate.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In practice, it is often difficult to spot the possible

                                supported by visualizing possible flow of messages and give hints on possible
                                sources of non-termination.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">We propose a termination analysis for distributed algorithms

                                pairs). We show that acyclicity of that graph implies termination. While many
                                interesting algorithms indeed contain cycles, we also suggest ways of detecting
                                cycles which cannot lead to non-termination.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Wikipedia states: "Situational awareness or situation awareness
                                (SA)
                                is the
                                perception of environmental elements and events with respect to time or space,
                                the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their future status."

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In 1976 John Boyd published a model he named OODA-loop (Observe,
                                Orient, Decide,
                                and Act) to capture the main elements of Situation Awareness. However, this is a
                                pre-IT model that needs to be updated to leverage as much IT technology as
                                possible; KIDS (Knowledge Intensive Data-management Systems) is such a model
                                [6]. KIDS captures data, identifies abnormal conditions, transforms the data
                                related to these abnormal conditions into the language of domain experts, give
                                guidance to the interpretation (classification and assessment), and recommends
                                reactions. While many required technologies, especially event processing, are
                                available they have to be embedded/organized into a comprehensive SA model; some
                                of these technologies must be extended and (significantly) improved.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Event-based systems encounter challenges of correctness and
                                consistency.
                                Correctness means that the execution results match the intention of the
                                designer. Consistency means that different data elements that co-exist within a
                                certain system creates an internal consistency with respect to the system's
                                requirements. In this tutorial, we cover the different aspects of correctness
                                and consistency. We discuss issues of correctness with respect of the temporal
                                properties of the system, such as order of events, and boundaries of time
                                windows. We further discuss the different aspects of fine-tuning required in
                                event-based system, where different semantic interpretations are possible, such
                                as: repeating events, or consumption. The consistency discussion relates to two
                                classic issues in the data management world: data dependencies and integrity
                                constraint enforcement. Since event-based systems typically consist of loosely
                                coupled component architecture in distributed environment, the challenge is
                                compliance with data dependencies and assertions about consistency. Finally, yet
                                importantly, we discuss the validation of event-based systems by using static
                                and dynamic analysis.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In the Big Data context, data streaming systems have been
                                introduced
                                to tame
                                velocity and enable reactive decision making. However, approaching such systems
                                is still too complex due to the paradigm shift they require, i.e., moving from
                                scalable batch processing to continuous analysis and detection. Initially,
                                modern big stream processing systems (e.g., Flink, Spark, Storm) have been
                                lacking the support of declarative languages to express the streaming-based data
                                processing tasks and have been mainly relying on providing low-level APIs for
                                the end-users to implement their tasks. However, recently, this fact has been
                                changing and most of them started to provide SQL-like languages for their
                                end-users.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In general, declarative Languages are playing a crucial role in
                                fostering the
                                adoption of Stream Processing. This tutorial focuses on introducing various
                                approaches for declarative querying of the state-of-the-art big data streaming
                                frameworks. In addition, we provide guidelines and practical examples on
                                developing and deploying Stream Processing applications using a variety of
                                SQL-like languages, such as Flink-SQL, KSQL and Spark Streaming SQL.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">Developing distributed systems is a complex task that requires

                                2. Object segmentation and noise reduction 3. Multi-class object classification
                                using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our evaluation shows that we can
                                classify objects with high accuracy using the point cloud data and neural
                                network. However, we observed that the classification may fail if the object
                                segmentation is not separating objects correctly in different segments
                                especially when the objects are largely covering each other. We proposed a
                                pre-processing approach for object segmentation based on separating LiDAR data
                                into multiple area sectors before segmenting the objects.</p>

                                and quality of life to its citizens. This quality of life can be achieved by providing a
                                cleaner and sustainable environment. However, the main mission of smart cities
                                is undermined due to the existing data-centric applications. Data-centric
                                approaches feed on the data of users and lack of users privacy and security. In
                                result, smart city solutions elected by city administration are not entirely
                                adopted by citizens. We need to understand the fact that each and every city and
                                its citizen are different from each other and the same solution cannot be
                                applied to all of them. If we will accept this fact then we can offer a
                                sustainable solution which will be used by city administration but also welcomed
                                by its citizens.</p>

                                respective cities. Our achievements lie in the fact that our solution cares
                                about citizens privacy first. Moreover, the platform can be scaled and adapted
                                to the heterogeneous demands of cities and citizens. As a result, it is most
                                welcomed by citizens and accepted by the city administration. However, we accept

                                tweaking the queries to deliver the desired results is challenging. For this
                                demonstration, we connected a database-backed CEP system (Jepc, ChronicleDB)

                                be adapted for different textual information filtering tasks, and puts emphasis
                                in user profile expressivity, intuitive UIs, and timely information delivery. To

                                common to employ in-network processing where the operators of a query are placed
                                at network nodes, especially those that act as data sources. While existing
                                operator placement algorithms handle distributed sources, query results are
                                gathered at one designated node -- the sink. We argue that such single-sink
                                solutions are not applicable for non-hierarchical systems, in which multiple
                                nodes need to be informed about query results. Also, in compositional

                                having a single sink enforces centralisation. Using a real-world application
                                scenario, we illustrate the need for a novel DCEP approach with a multi-sink
                                operator placement. Furthermore, we elaborate on the requirements to be

                                presents ongoing work on the implementation of FlowGraph, a framework to
                                recognize temporal patterns over properties of large-scale graphs. FlowGraph
                                combines the programming paradigm of traditional graph computation frameworks
                                with the temporal pattern detection capabilities of Complex Event Recognition
                                (CER) systems. In a nutshell, FlowGraph distributes the graph data structure
                                across multiple nodes that also contribute to the computation and store partial
                                results for pattern detection. It exploits temporal properties to defer as much

                                connected, an
                                enormous
                                amount of streaming data is being produced with very high velocity. In order to
                                process these large number of data streams, a variety of stream processing
                                platforms and query engines are emerging. In the stream query processing, an
                                infinite data stream is divided into small chunks of finite data using a window
                                operator. Window size and its type play an important role in the performance of
                                any stream query engine. Due to the dynamic nature of IoT, data stream rate
                                fluctuates very often, thus impeding the performance of query engines. In this
                                work, we investigated the impact of any changes in data stream rates over the
                                performance of a distributed query engine (e.g. Flink -
                                https://flink.apache.org/). Our evaluation results indicate a direct impact of
                                any changes in stream rate and window size over the performance of the engines.
                                We propose an adaptive and dynamic query window size and type selector to
                                improve the resilience of query processing engines. We consider several
                                characteristics of input data streams, application workload, and resource
                                constraints and proposes an optimal stream query window size and type for stream
                                query execution.</p>

                                meeting reminders and other messages which need to be forwarded from
                                applications to various mobile network operators, to eventually be delivered to
                                the users' mobile phones. To avoid message loss in the case of server failures,
                                each message needs to be stored on one or more of the other servers until it has
                                been successfully delivered. When this replication is implemented using a
                                traditional clustered database (e.g., FairCom CTree, MongoDB, and MySQL), we
                                achieve an unacceptably low throughput of at most a few hundred messages per
                                second (MPS) getting stored, marked as being processed by a single server, and
                                then finally deleted.</p>

                                for this use case. An early version of such a protocol has been able to reach a
                                throughput of about 14 000 MPS.</p>
                            <p class="justifyAlignment">The existing replication protocols use a general system model
                                which

                                common situations. By carefully scrutinizing this model and discarding
                                assumptions not applicable in our particular situation, e.g. a consistent global
                                order, we should be able to achieve a significantly higher throughput.</p>

                                processing pipelines. Existing graph processing systems mostly focus on static
                                graphs and lack the essential support for pattern detection and event processing
                                in graph-shaped data. On the other hand, stream processing systems support event
                                and pattern detection, but they are inadequate for graph processing. This work
                                lies at the intersection of the graph and stream processing domains with the
                                following objectives: (i) It introduces the syntax of a language for the
                                detection of temporal patterns in large-scale graphs. (ii) It presents a novel
                                data structure called distributed label store (DLS) to efficiently store graph
                                computation results and discover temporal patterns within them. The proposed
                                system, called FlowGraph, unifies graph-shaped data with stream processing by
                                observing graph changes as a stream flowing into the system. It provides an API
                                to handle temporal patterns that predicate on the results of graph computations
                                with traditional graph computations.</p>

                            <p class="justifyAlignment">In this doctoral work we investigate how DSP systems can face
                                the
                                dynamicity of
                                workloads and computing environments by self-adapting their deployment and
                                behavior at run-time. Targeting geo-distributed infrastructures, we specifically
                                search for decentralized solutions, and propose a framework for organizing
                                adaptation using a hierarchical control approach. Focusing on application
                                elasticity, we equip the framework with decentralized policies based on
                                reinforcement learning. We extend our solution to consider multi-level
                                elasticity, and heterogeneous computing resources. In the ongoing research work,
                                we aim to face the challenges associated with mobility of users and computing
                                resources, exploring complementary adaptation mechanisms.</p>
